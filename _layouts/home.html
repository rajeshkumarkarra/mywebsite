    <h3 class="fw-bold">About me</h3>
    <p>I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the <a class="other" href='https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-electrical-engineering'>School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University</a> (Espoo, Finland), and I am affiliated with the <a class="other" href='https://fcai.fi/'>Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI)</a>. Just before starting this position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IMT Nord Europe (Lille, France) and a visiting researcher at the University of Edinburgh, working mainly with <a class="other" href='https://victorelvira.github.io/'>Prof. Víctor Elvira</a>. I finished the Ph.D. in Multimedia and Communications (Statistical Signal Processing) from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2022, under the supervision of <a class="other" href='https://jmiguez.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/'>Prof. Joaquín Míguez</a>.</p>     
    <!-- Before that and in the same college, I got my master's degree in Multimedia and Communications, as well as my master's degree in Telecommunications Engineering in 2017. Previously, I finished my Telecommunications Engineering bachelor's degree from Universidade de Vigo in 2015. -->
    
    <p>My <strong>research interests</strong> are focused on computational statistics, data assimilation, and signal processing. More specifically, I am interested in Bayesian inference in state-space models. I work on providing new techniques that run recursively (online) with reduced computational complexity (compared to the state-of-the-art methods) to obtain both parameter and state estimates. I'm also interested in the application of these probabilistic methods in different fields of science such as ecology, energy, geoscience, and climate. </p>

I recently gave IELTS Academic on 10th October 2020. I got an overall 8.0 band with L-9.0, R-8.5, W-6.5, S-7.0. I prepared the Listening and Reading Section by practicing timed mock tests for each section everyday for one month or so from the [Cambridge IELTS Book](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17viEpxn-tctdVfh8XqdnfPOuEONc62lJ?usp=sharing) [[1]](https://practicepteonline.com/cambridge-ielts-1-13-tests/) [[2]](https://practicepteonline.com/official-ielts-18-test/)[[3]](https://practicepteonline.com/) (available on Amazon).

[Cambridge IELTS Book](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17viEpxn-tctdVfh8XqdnfPOuEONc62lJ?usp=sharing)
And, for the writing section, I referred to this website called IELTSJacky, a very useful site for writing section.

[IELTSLiz's](https://ieltsliz.com/) website and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ieltsliz/playlists) are also very good resources. Please watch all her videos.

And, for speaking, I didn't prepare much for it. Just read what was given in that [Cambridge IELTS Book](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17viEpxn-tctdVfh8XqdnfPOuEONc62lJ?usp=sharing). But, I suggest you practice daily.

Here's some tips that would definitely get you a high score:

Give one Listening and Reading Test from Cambridge IELTS Book everyday. ( You can also use [Barron's IELTS Book](https://images.static-collegedunia.com/public/college_data/images/entrance/entrance_brochure/1608285641Barron's%20IELTS.pdf)[1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17viEpxn-tctdVfh8XqdnfPOuEONc62lJ?usp=sharing))
Practice Writing Task 1 & 2 not everyday but 2 or 3 days a week
For Speaking Test, practice the most common topics for Part 2 and for Part 1 they only ask basic questions about yourself, so you are set for that. And, for Part 3, it's just a discussion between you and the examiner that would be related to the topic asked in Part 2.
Important:

Please don't memorize answers.
Be natural. And, remember that IELTS is a test of your language not your knowledge. So, if you are asked about something that you have never heard of or know nothing about, don't be scared.
Refer to this YT Channel: [E2 Learning for Speaking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCglDIsg_Z9mE2oT9hsrbzFA), they have this PPF method that would help a lot in Part 2 Speaking. Don't forget to watch that video. It's very important.
